## The Solution

*The Netty project* is an effort to provide an asynchronous event-driven network application framework and tooling for the rapid development of maintainable high-performance and high-scalability protocol servers and clients.

In other words, Netty is an NIO client server framework that enables quick and easy development of network applications such as protocol servers and clients. It greatly simplifies and streamlines network programming such as TCP and UDP socket server development.

'Quick and easy' does not mean that a resulting application will suffer from a maintainability or a performance issue. Netty has been designed carefully with the experiences learned from the implementation of a lot of protocols such as FTP, SMTP, HTTP, and various binary and text-based legacy protocols. As a result, Netty has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, and flexibility without a compromise.

Some users might already have found other network application frameworks that claim to have the same advantage, and you might want to ask what makes Netty so different from them. The answer is the philosophy it is built on. Netty is designed to give you the most comfortable experience both in terms of the API and the implementation from day one. It is not something tangible but you will realize that this philosophy will make your life much easier as you read this guide and play with Netty.
